/** OxenMQ address abstraction class.  This class uses and extends standard ZMQ addresses allowing
 * extra parameters to be passed in in a relative standard way.
 *
 * External ZMQ addresses generally have two forms that we are concerned with: one for TCP and one
 * for Unix sockets:
 *
 *     tcp://HOST:PORT -- HOST can be a hostname, IPv4 address, or IPv6 address in [...]
 *     ipc://PATH      -- PATH can be absolute (ipc:///path/to/some.sock) or relative (ipc://some.sock)
 *
 * but this doesn't carry enough info: in particular, we can connect with two very different
 * protocols: curve25519-encrypted, or plaintext, but for curve25519-encrypted we require the
 * remote's public key as well to verify the connection.
 *
 * This class, then, handles this by allowing addresses of:
 *
 * Standard ZMQ address: these carry no pubkey and so the connection will be unencrypted:
 *
 *     tcp://HOSTNAME:PORT
 *     ipc://PATH
 *
 * Non-ZMQ address formats that specify that the connection shall be x25519 encrypted:
 *
 *     curve://HOSTNAME:PORT/PUBKEY -- PUBKEY must be specified in hex (64 characters), base32z (52)
 *                                     or base64 (43 or 44 with one '=' trailing padding)
 *     ipc+curve:///path/to/my.sock/PUBKEY -- same requirements on PUBKEY as above.
 *     tcp+curve://(whatever) -- alias for curve://(whatever)
 *
 * We also accept special upper-case TCP-only variants which *only* accept uppercase characters and
 * a few required symbols (:, /, $, ., and -) in the string:
 *
 *     TCP://HOSTNAME:PORT
 *     CURVE://HOSTNAME:PORT/B32ZPUBKEY
 *
 * These versions are explicitly meant to be used with QR codes; the upper-case-only requirement
 * allows a smaller QR code by allowing QR's alphanumeric mode (which allows only [A-Z0-9 $%*+./:-])
 * to be used.  Such a QR-friendly address can be created from the qr_address() method.  To support
 * literal IPv6 addresses we surround the address with $...$ instead of the usual [...].
 *
 * Note that this class does very little validate the host argument at all, and no socket path
 * validation whatsoever.  The only constraint on host is when parsing an encoded address: we check
 * that it contains no : at all, or must be a [bracketed] expression that contains only hex
 * characters, :'s, or .'s.  Otherwise, if you pass broken crap into the hostname, expect broken
 * crap out.
